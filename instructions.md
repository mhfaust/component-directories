Let's pick up where we left off before the connection was lost:

- You're helping me learn how to create VSCode extensions in typescript by working on an extension I have in mind to generate a set of files from templates when I right-click on a directory in the file-browser.
- You've walked me through stubbing out the extension by installing generate-code and calling `yo code`.
- You showed me extension.ts me and the "activate" function, and generated some relevant code for me to put in it.
- Here is the current state of extension.ts:

```TS
// The module 'vscode' contains the VS Code extensibility API
// Import the module and reference it with the alias vscode in your code below
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

// This method is called when your extension is activated
// Your extension is activated the very first time the command is executed
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {

	let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.createReactComponent', async (uri: vscode.Uri) => {

		// Check if the path is null or undefined.
		  if (!uri || !uri.fsPath) {
			  vscode.window.showErrorMessage("Please right-click a directory to generate the component.");
			  return;
		  }

		  const componentName = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
			  prompt: 'Component name in PascalCase',
			  placeHolder: 'e.g. MyComponent'
		  });

		  if (!componentName) {
			  return; // User canceled the input or entered nothing
		  }

		  console.log('Chosen path:', uri.fsPath); // Use the path
		  console.log('Chosen name:', componentName); // Use the component name

		  // In the next step, we would use the 'componentName' and 'uri.fsPath' here to create files and directories.
	  });

	  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);

}

// This method is called when your extension is deactivated
export function deactivate() {}
```

Now, I have not been able to test this yet. When I attempt to run the extension via fn+F5, I get an error:
`Cannot find module 'vscode' or its corresponding type declarations.`,

```
__COMPONENT_NAME__/
    __COMPONENT_NAME__.tsx
    __COMPONENT_NAME__.module.scss
    __COMPONENT_NAME__.test.tsx
```
